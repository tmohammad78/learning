## Part 1 : Choosing Your Market

### Lead Or Bleed
The risk-reward trade-off is an important part of making intentional choices about which technologies and domains to invest in.

what I’ve been talking about is the difference between choosing technologies that are still on the bleeding edge and technologies that are firmly entrenched.

Make a list of early, middle, and late adoption technologies based on today’s market. Map them out on paper from left to right; the left is bleeding edge, and the right is filled by technologies that are in their sunsets. then,perhaps in a different color, mark the ones that you have some experience with but aren’t authoritative on.

### Supply and Demand
If there are more people who want the item than there are items available to be purchased,
the price of the item will increase as potential buyers compete.

The offshore software trend has just injected a large supply of low-cost IT people into our economy.
focusing on niche technologies is a strategy that,although not necessarily making the competition less fierce (there are fewer jobs to go around), might change the focus of competition from price to ability. That’s what you need. You can’t compete on price, but
you can compete on ability.

Research current technical skill demand. Use job posting and career websites to find out which skills are in high demand and in low demand.

Do a similar comparison between leading-edge technologies and the skills available via offshore outsourcing firms. Keep your eyes on both sets of technical skills that are underserved by the offshore companies.

### Coding Don’t Cut It Anymore
You might be **just a programmer,** but being able to speak to your business clients in the language of their business domain is a critical skill. Imagine how much easier life would be if everyone you had to work with really understood how software development works.

This is how your business clients feel about you: Imagine how much easier it would be to work with these programmers if they just understood what I was asking them for without me having to dumb everything down and be so ridiculously specific!

Schedule lunch with a businessperson. Talk to them about how they do their job. As you talk to them, ask yourself what you would have to change or learn if you aspired to have their job. Ask about the specifics of their daily work. Talk to them about how technol-
ogy helps them (or slows them down) on the job. Think about your work from their perspective

### Be The Worst
Being the worst guy in the band means always playing with people who are better than you.

The people around you affect your own performance. Choose your crowd wisely Find a **be the worst** situation for yourself. You may not have the luxury of immediately switching teams or companies just because you want to work with better people. Instead, find a volunteer project on which you can work with other developers who will
make you better via osmosis.

If you don’t have an active developer community nearby, use the Internet. Pick an open source project that you admire and whose developers appear to be at that “next level” you’re looking to reach. Go through the project’s to-do list or mailing list archives,
pick a feature or a major bug fix,

### Invest in Your Intelligence
When choosing what to focus on, it can be tempting to simply look at the technologies that yield the most jobs and focus on those.

For me, as a hiring manager, the first reason is that it shows that you’re interested. If I know you learned something for the sake of self-development and (better) pure fun, I know you are excited and motivated about your profession.

It drives me crazy to ask people whether they’ve seen or used certain not-quite-mainstream technologies only to hear, “I haven’t been given the opportunity to work on that” in return. Given the opportunity? Neither was I! I took the opportunity to learn.

More important than portraying the perception of being suitably motivated and engaged by your field is that exposure the to these fringe technologies and methodologies actually makes you deeper, better,smarter, and more creative.
I haven’t been given opportunity...? Seize the opportunity!

Learn a new programming language. But, don’t go from Java to C# or from C to C++. Learn a new language that makes you think in a new way. If you’re a Java or C# programmer, try learning a language like Smalltalk or Ruby that doesn’t employ strong, static typing. Or, if you’ve been doing object-oriented programming for a long time, try a functional language like Haskell or Scheme. You don’t have to become an expert. Work through enough code that you truly feel the difference in the new programming environment. If it doesn’t feel strange enough, either you’ve picked the wrong language or you’re applying your old way of thinking to the new language. Go out of your way to learn the idioms of the new language. Ask old-timers to review your code and make
suggestions that would make it more idiomatically correct.

## Part 2 : Investing in your product
This is one piece of proof that if you want to have a great product to sell on the job market a product that stands out and that lets you really compete you’re going to have to invest in that product.
In this part, we’ll look at investment strategies for your career. We will explore how to choose which skills and technologies to invest in as well as look at different ways of investing in ourselves. This part is where the real work starts.

### Learn to Fish
Lao Tzu said, “Give a man a fish; feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish; feed him for a lifetime.” That’s all well and good. But Lao Tzu left out the part where the man doesn’t want to learn how to fish and he asks you for another fish tomorrow. Education requires both a teacher and a student. Many of us are too often reluctant to be a student.

Who wants to be at the mercy of someone else? Or, worse: if you were looking to hire someone to do a job for you, would you want that person to be at the mercy of the experts? I wouldn’t. I’d want to hire someone who is self-sufficient.

If your code has a critical bug in the middle of the night, you don’t want to have to call someone else to ask them to get you the right version so you can start troubleshooting.
Ask for a fish; eat for a day. Ask someone to teach you to fish; eat for a lifetime.” Better yet, don’t ask to be taught go learn for yourself.

**How and why?** -Either as you sit here reading or the next time you’re at work, think about the facets of your job that you may not fully understand. You can ask yourself two extremely useful questions about any given area to drill down into the murky layers: How
does it work? and Why does this (have to) happen? You may not even be able to answer the questions, but the very act of asking them will put you into a new frame of mind and
will generate a higher level of awareness about your work environment.
**Tip time**—Pick one of the most critical but neglected tools in your toolbox to focus on. Perhaps it’s your version control system, perhaps a library that you use extensively but you’ve looked into only superficially, or maybe the editor you use when programming.
When you’ve picked the tool, allot yourself a small period of time each day to learn one new thing about the tool that will make you more productive or put you in better control over your development environment.
