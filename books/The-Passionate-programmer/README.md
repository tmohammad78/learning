## Part 1 : Choosing Your Market

### Lead Or Bleed
The risk-reward trade-off is an important part of making intentional choices about which technologies and domains to invest in.

what I’ve been talking about is the difference between choosing technologies that are still on the bleeding edge and technologies that are firmly entrenched.

Make a list of early, middle, and late adoption technologies based on today’s market. Map them out on paper from left to right; the left is bleeding edge, and the right is filled by technologies that are in their sunsets. then,perhaps in a different color, mark the ones that you have some experience with but aren’t authoritative on.

### Supply and Demand
If there are more people who want the item than there are items available to be purchased,
the price of the item will increase as potential buyers compete.

The offshore software trend has just injected a large supply of low-cost IT people into our economy.
focusing on niche technologies is a strategy that,although not necessarily making the competition less fierce (there are fewer jobs to go around), might change the focus of competition from price to ability. That’s what you need. You can’t compete on price, but
you can compete on ability.

Research current technical skill demand. Use job posting and career websites to find out which skills are in high demand and in low demand.

Do a similar comparison between leading-edge technologies and the skills available via offshore outsourcing firms. Keep your eyes on both sets of technical skills that are underserved by the offshore companies.

### Coding Don’t Cut It Anymore
You might be **just a programmer,** but being able to speak to your business clients in the language of their business domain is a critical skill. Imagine how much easier life would be if everyone you had to work with really understood how software development works.

This is how your business clients feel about you: Imagine how much easier it would be to work with these programmers if they just understood what I was asking them for without me having to dumb everything down and be so ridiculously specific!

Schedule lunch with a businessperson. Talk to them about how they do their job. As you talk to them, ask yourself what you would have to change or learn if you aspired to have their job. Ask about the specifics of their daily work. Talk to them about how technol-
ogy helps them (or slows them down) on the job. Think about your work from their perspective

### Be The Worst
Being the worst guy in the band means always playing with people who are better than you.

The people around you affect your own performance. Choose your crowd wisely Find a **be the worst** situation for yourself. You may not have the luxury of immediately switching teams or companies just because you want to work with better people. Instead, find a volunteer project on which you can work with other developers who will
make you better via osmosis.

If you don’t have an active developer community nearby, use the Internet. Pick an open source project that you admire and whose developers appear to be at that “next level” you’re looking to reach. Go through the project’s to-do list or mailing list archives,
pick a feature or a major bug fix,

### Invest in Your Intelligence
When choosing what to focus on, it can be tempting to simply look at the technologies that yield the most jobs and focus on those.

For me, as a hiring manager, the first reason is that it shows that you’re interested. If I know you learned something for the sake of self-development and (better) pure fun, I know you are excited and motivated about your profession.

It drives me crazy to ask people whether they’ve seen or used certain not-quite-mainstream technologies only to hear, “I haven’t been given the opportunity to work on that” in return. Given the opportunity? Neither was I! I took the opportunity to learn.

More important than portraying the perception of being suitably motivated and engaged by your field is that exposure the to these fringe technologies and methodologies actually makes you deeper, better,smarter, and more creative.
I haven’t been given opportunity...? Seize the opportunity!

Learn a new programming language. But, don’t go from Java to C# or from C to C++. Learn a new language that makes you think in a new way. If you’re a Java or C# programmer, try learning a language like Smalltalk or Ruby that doesn’t employ strong, static typing. Or, if you’ve been doing object-oriented programming for a long time, try a functional language like Haskell or Scheme. You don’t have to become an expert. Work through enough code that you truly feel the difference in the new programming environment. If it doesn’t feel strange enough, either you’ve picked the wrong language or you’re applying your old way of thinking to the new language. Go out of your way to learn the idioms of the new language. Ask old-timers to review your code and make
suggestions that would make it more idiomatically correct.

## Part 2 : Investing in your product
This is one piece of proof that if you want to have a great product to sell on the job market a product that stands out and that lets you really compete you’re going to have to invest in that product.<br />
In this part, we’ll look at investment strategies for your career. We will explore how to choose which skills and technologies to invest in as well as look at different ways of investing in ourselves. This part is where the real work starts.

### Learn to Fish
Lao Tzu said, “Give a man a fish; feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish; feed him for a lifetime.” That’s all well and good. But Lao Tzu left out the part where the man doesn’t want to learn how to fish and he asks you for another fish tomorrow. Education requires both a teacher and a student. Many of us are too often reluctant to be a student.<br />

Who wants to be at the mercy of someone else? Or, worse: if you were looking to hire someone to do a job for you, would you want that person to be at the mercy of the experts? I wouldn’t. I’d want to hire someone who is self-sufficient.<br />

If your code has a critical bug in the middle of the night, you don’t want to have to call someone else to ask them to get you the right version so you can start troubleshooting.
Ask for a fish; eat for a day. Ask someone to teach you to fish; eat for a lifetime.” Better yet, don’t ask to be taught go learn for yourself.

**How and why?** -Either as you sit here reading or the next time you’re at work, think about the facets of your job that you may not fully understand. You can ask yourself two extremely useful questions about any given area to drill down into the murky layers: How
does it work? and Why does this (have to) happen? You may not even be able to answer the questions, but the very act of asking them will put you into a new frame of mind and
will generate a higher level of awareness about your work environment. <br />
**Tip time**—Pick one of the most critical but neglected tools in your toolbox to focus on. Perhaps it’s your version control system, perhaps a library that you use extensively but you’ve looked into only superficially, or maybe the editor you use when programming.
When you’ve picked the tool, allot yourself a small period of time each day to learn one new thing about the tool that will make you more productive or put you in better control over your development environment.

#### Learn How Businesses Really Work
Before making an investment in learning the ins and outs of a business domain, you should make sure you’re investing in the right one for you and for the state of the market.

Looking back on it, I realize how foolish we were. We worked for a business, and our job was to contribute to either making or saving money for that business. <br />
You can’t creatively help a business until you know how it works. <br />
how were we supposed to creatively help the business be profitable if we didn’t even understand how the business worked?

Given the right projects and leadership,we should be putting effort into tasks that help the business. We don’t need to fully understand how a business runs to provide value to it. But, to creatively add value takes a more thorough understanding of the business environment in which you work. I

#### Find a Mentor  
It’s OK to depend on someone. Just make sure it's right person. A mentor can also give structure to your learning process . <br />
When I prodded him to give me direction on how to become more knowledgeable and self-sufficient, he gave me a simple recipe: dive into directory services, get comfortable with a UNIX variant, and master a scripting language.

#### Be a Mentor
There’s no better way to crystallize your understanding of something than to force yourself to express it to someone else so that they can understand it. <br />
To find out whether you really know something, try teaching it to someone else. <br />
Look for someone to take under your wing. You might find someone younger and less experienced at your company, perhaps an intern. Or, you could talk to the computer science or information
systems department at your local university and volunteer to mentor a college student

#### Practice, Practice, Practice
When you practice music, it shouldn’t sound good. If you always sound good during practice sessions, it means you’re not stretching your limits. As an industry, we need to make time for practice.We have to invest the time in our craft.<br />
**Practice at your limits.** <br />
So, how do you know what to practice? What stretches your limits? The subject of how to practice as a software developer could easily fill a book of its own. <br />
What about the dusty corners of your primary programming language that you rarely visit? For example, does your programming language of choice support regular expressions?Most developers don’t use them when they could, because they don’t have the level of skill that it would take to be productive with them. As a result, a lot of needless string parsing code gets created and then has to be maintained. <br />
when they could really help you. Try truly digging into, for example, the way multi threaded programming works in your chosen programming environment.<br />
An excellent place to find new code with which to practice is the open source community.
Do you have any favorite pieces of open source software? How about trying to add a feature? Go look at the to-do list for a piece of software you’d like to practice with, and give yourself a constrained amount of time to implement the new feature .
**Try different types of software in different styles and languages.**

Improvisation: Improvisation is taking some structure or constraint and creating something new, on the fly, on top of that structure. As a programmer, I’ve found myself doing the most improvisation in times of stress. Oh no! The wireless network app server is down, and we’re losing orders! That’s when some of the most creative, impromptu programming happens. That’s when you do crazy stuff like recovering lost data by manually replaying packets over a wireless network from a binary log file.

A great way to sharpen the mind and improve your improvisational coding skills is to practice with self-imposed constraints. Pick a simple program, and try to write it with these constraints.<br/>
The important thing is to find your practice needs and to make sure you’re not practicing during your performances (on the job). You have to make time for practice. It’s your responsibility.

#### The Way That You Do It
“Developing software” is not a thing, a noun. Instead, “developing software” is a verb phrase; it’s the process of creating a thing .  <br/>
If you want to feel you own a process, help implement it.

#### On the Shoulders of Giants
A positive side effect of reading code is that you will learn more about what already exists. When you have a new problem that needs solving, you might remember that “Oh, I saw a library that implements MIME type handling in such and such project.”

Pick a project, and read it like a book. Make notes. Outline the good and the bad. Write a critique, and publish it. Find at least one trick or pattern that you can use from it. Find at least one bad thing that you observed that you will add to your “What not to do” checklist when you’re developing software.

#### Automate Yourself into a Job
Since we don’t yet know how to truly measure software development productivity, it’s hard to prove that one person is faster than another.So, finance managers focus on per-hour costs.<br />
imagine your company is in the business of creating websites for small businesses. You basically need to create the same site over and over again, with contacts, surveys, shopping carts, the works. You could either hire a small number of really fast programmers to build
the sites for you, hire an army of low-cost programmers to do the whole thing manually and repetitively, or create a system for generating the sites.<br />
Pick a task you normally do repetitively, and write a code generaor for it. Start simple. Don’t worry about reusability. Just make sure your generator saves you time. Think of a way to raise the level of abstraction of what you are generating.


## Part 3: Executing 
### Mind Reader
start making some notes about what you think your users and managers are going to ask for. Be creative. Try to see the system from their points of view. After you have a list of the not-so-obvious features that might come up, think about how you could most effectively implement each feature. Think about edge cases that your users might not immediately have in mind. 

### Daily Hit
Common sense tells us that if we exceed our managers’ expectations, we’ll be on the A list. Given that exceeding expectations is a worthy goal, surprisingly few of us have mechanisms of tracking how and when we exceed the expectations of our employers.<br />
Without warning his manager, he started tracking daily hits.some idea he had thought of or implemented that would make his department better.
Simply setting a goal (daily, weekly, or whatever you’re capable of) and tracking this type of accomplishment can radically change your behavior.<br />
**Act On It** <br/>
Block off half an hour on your calendar, and sit down with a pencil and paper in a quiet place where you won’t be interrupted. Think about the little nitpicky problems your team puts up with on a daily basis. Write them down. What are the annoying tasks that waste a few minutes of the team’s time each day but nobody has had the time or energy to do anything about? <br/>
Give yourself a solid twenty minutes of this. Write down all of your ideas—good or bad. Don’t allow yourself to quit until the twenty minutes are up.write out your five favorite (most annoying) items. Next week, on Monday, take the first item from the list, and do something about it. On Tuesday, take the second item, Wednesday the third, and so on.

### Remember Who You Work For 
Make sure your goals and your work align with the goals of your business.
it’s all fine and dandy to say we need to align our work with the goals of the company—to try to make sure we’re impacting the bottom line and all that.
The most obvious puddle to start with is your own team. It’s probably small and focused enough that you can conceptually wrap yourself around it.<br />
Ultimately, in a well-structured environment, the goals of your manager are the goals of your team.
