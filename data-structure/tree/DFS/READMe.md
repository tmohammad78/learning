# DFS 
Depth-first search is like walking through a corn maze. You explore one path, hit a dead end, and go back and try a different one.

we use stack for solving this or jusr a recursive 

* Depth-first search on a binary tree generally requires less memory than breadth-first.
* A DFS doesn't necessarily find the shortest path to a node, while breadth-first search does.
