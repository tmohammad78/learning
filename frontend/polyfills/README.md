# Polyfills
When we want to use new version of javascript in the old browsers we have two solution to use these new features in old browser . 
1. Transpile
2. Polyfills

For first solution , we can use Babel or SWC to transpile the code , [sample](https://github.com/tmohammad78/learning/tree/main/frontend/babel)
In the second solution , we not transpile the code , but adds missing implementations for the particular case  , two library : **corejs** , **polyfill.io**
